If still facing the 'Thank you for choosing our product , Goto Installation' screen event. 
The possible issue is that the admin panel couldn't connect to the api (backend). All you need do is edit the file:

..\demand24_admin-main\src\configs\app-global.js

change info your domain:
export const BASE_URL = 'https://api.demand24.org';
export const WEBSITE_URL = 'https://demand24.org';
